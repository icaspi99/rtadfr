Description: rtadfr (right-tail augmented Dickey-Fuller with R), an R package that facilitates
              the performance of time series based tests that help detect and date-stamp asset price bubbles.
              The detection strategy is based on a right-tail variation of the standard augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
              where the alternative hypothesis is of a mildly explosive process. Rejection of the null in each of these
              tests may serve as empirical evidence for an asset price bubble. The package implements three types
              of tests: standard ADF, supremum ADF (SADF; Phillips, Wu, and Yu 2011) 
              and generalized SADF (GSADF; Phillips, Shi, and Yu 2015). The package provides critical and p values
              based on either super-fast surface function approximations or on Monte Carlo simulations.
