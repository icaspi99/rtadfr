Description: rtadfr (right-tail augmented Dickey-Fuller with R), an R package that facilitates
              the performance of time series based tests that help detect and date-stamp asset price bubbles.
              The detection strategy is based on a right-tail variation of the standard augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
              where the alternative hypothesis is of a mildly explosive process. Rejection of the null in each of these
              tests may serve as empirical evidence for an asset price bubble. The package implements three types
              of tests: standard ADF, supremum ADF (SADF; Phillips, Wu, and Yu 2011) 
              and generalized SADF (GSADF; Phillips, Shi, and Yu 2015). It calculates the test statistics
              for each of the above four tests, simulates the corresponding exact finite sample critical values
              and p values via Monte Carlo methods, under the assumption of Gaussian innovations.
